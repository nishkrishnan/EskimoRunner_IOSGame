# EskimoRunner: IOS Game

##Disclaimer
This prototype has been made with various graphics collected on the internet. I do not own them, I have used them for purposes of materializing the concept of the game.

##Description
2D platformer where an "Eskimo" is running and can jump and throw weapons at oncoming monsters. The monsters can move in different paths as to be confusing for the player. Currently there are only two monsters due to lack of proper graphics. 

The reason for making this game was mainly to experiment with Apple's API SpriteKit with which this game is made. 

Screenshots of the game with various unrelated graphics are below. Will upload a proper version of this game once I have access to someone with photoshop knowledge :).
